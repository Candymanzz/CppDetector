# Decisions

## D1 - Build stack (2026-10-20)
Context: no C++ OpenCV on machine; Python OpenCV unusable; MSVC Build Tools 2022 present.
Decision: CMake + vcpkg manifest (vcpkg at D:\vcpkg), opencv4 minimal features (jpeg, png), cpp-httplib, nlohmann-json.
Why: one reproducible dependency flow, header-only web server keeps the app a single exe.
Consequences: first configure builds OpenCV (20-40 min); later builds are cached.

## D2 - Alignment strategy (2026-10-20)
Decision: only translation via cv::phaseCorrelate + a per-camera shift tolerance (px) applied in diff (min over neighborhood). No ORB/ECC.
Why: 500 ms budget for 10 frames; user said micro-shifts are minor and should be handled by a tolerance setting.
Consequences: rotations/large shifts are not corrected; flagged as reason `shift_exceeded`.

## D3 - Reference selection (2026-10-20)
Decision: reference per camera = earliest frame by folder name; can be re-picked from UI.
Why: user wants to emulate real inspection: first frame becomes reference, later frames are checked against it.

## D4 - First measurements (2026-10-20)
Console runner, 10 cameras in parallel via std::async, full-frame ROI, sens 0.5, includes JPEG decode: batch wall time 190-260 ms (budget 500).
Clean frames score ~0.00-0.05%. Synthetic defect (ellipse + line, ~0.5% of frame) scores 0.5-0.66% on all cameras and zones are localized correctly (also on overexposed cameras 6-9).
Known: cam 0 shows a tiny false zone on the bucket rim (sub-pixel/shift edge) -> an ROI polygon and/or higher shiftTolerance is the remedy, not code changes.
Open: sensitivity->threshold mapping (80..5) is a first guess, tune with real defects.

## D5 - Web UI and API (2026-10-20)
Decision: cpp-httplib server serves static files from <repo>/web (plain HTML/JS/CSS, no bundler) and a JSON API under /api. App (src/app) owns state; routes (src/web/routes.cpp) are thin.
Why: single exe, no Node toolchain, easy to iterate on the UI without rebuilding C++.
Consequences: the UI must be launched with cwd-independent paths (CD_SOURCE_DIR compile definition = repo root; override with --frames/--web/--port).
- Per-camera mutex in App::Cam guards reference/ROI/params/last result; the emulated stream and manual inspections serialize per camera, run in parallel across cameras.
- Config persisted to config/config.json (params, ROI, reference name; uploaded reference stored as config/ref_cam<N>.png). Every change autosaves.
- Frame names accepted by the API must exist in the camera's own listing (no path traversal). Reject images served only by plain file name from logs/rejects.
- Test aids: synthetic defect injection (global stream flag or per-run checkbox), "inspect all frames of camera", upload of an arbitrary frame/reference.

## D6 - Auto-ROI (2026-10-20)
Decision: blur -> Otsu -> open/close -> blob closest to centre and largest -> convex hull -> approxPolyDP (<=14 vertices). Only a proposal; applied then edited by hand.
Result: cam 0-5 get a plausible but too generous polygon (includes neighbouring bright objects at the left/bottom). Cam 6-9 (overexposed) get an almost full-frame polygon. Needs manual edit; improve only if the user asks.

## D7 - Heatmap rendering (2026-10-20)
Heatmap colours are normalised to the detection threshold (thr -> mid colour, 2*thr -> red); values below thr/2 are not painted. Otherwise JPEG/lighting noise paints the whole bucket.

## D8 - Findings on the real label shots (2026-10-20)
Setup: reference good1, ROI polygon over the bucket body (excludes lid reflections and neighbouring objects), sensitivity 1.0, reject threshold 0.1%.
- downscale 0.4: good2 0.00%, bad1 0.62%, bad2 0.38%, bad21 0.35% -> clean separation, ~60-110 ms per frame (single).
- downscale 0.6/0.8/1.0: bad scores grow (bad1 1.4/2.2/3.1%), good2 stays 0.00%, but time per frame grows 130/230/330-390 ms (single frame) - too slow for 10 parallel frames in 500 ms without enough cores.
- Without ROI, lid glare and a neighbouring object produce large false zones -> ROI is mandatory for this scene.
- Dark images: contrast of defects is low, sensitivity had to be at the maximum (diff threshold 5). Candidate improvement: contrast stretch by ROI percentile before diff (not done yet) so that sensitivity is meaningful across lighting.
- bad1 false zones along the label's left/right edges come from bucket rotation (translation-only alignment, D2). Candidate improvements: exclude edge band from ROI, or local/affine alignment.
- Added Inspector guard: frame size != reference size -> reason `size_mismatch` (no crash; verdict NO_REFERENCE).

## D9 - Benchmark: 10 cameras in parallel over all frames (2026-10-20)
Tool: `cppdetector --bench [--verbose]` (src/app/bench.cpp). Machine: 8 hardware threads. One batch = one frame per camera, 10 tasks via std::async.
- Camera dataset 960x803, downscale 1.0, ref = earliest frame, 19 batches x 10 cameras = 190 frames: total ~4.3 s, batch avg 225 / p95 255 / max 255 ms (with JPEG decode: avg 240 / max 287 ms). Budget 500 ms met with ~2x margin. 0 rejects (clean frames).
- Label shots 2448x2048 (reference good1, body ROI, sens 1.0, thr 0.1), 10 virtual cameras: downscale 0.4 -> batch avg 273-307 ms (OK); 0.5 -> 395-437 ms (OK, thin margin); 0.6 -> 592-653 ms (over budget). 30 of 40 frames rejected = exactly the 3 bad files x 10 cameras; good2 never rejected.
- A single frame alone takes ~60 ms (960x803) but ~210 ms when 10 run at once: the batch is CPU-bound (10 tasks on 8 logical threads, likely 4 physical cores). cv::setNumThreads(1) made no real difference.
- Next speed levers if needed: phaseCorrelate on a much smaller image (it is a full float DFT), avoid redundant float conversions, reuse buffers per camera, stable thread pool instead of std::async.

## D10 - Benchmark on frames36 (1224x1024, 10 cameras, 99 batches = 990 frames) (2026-10-20)
Defaults sens 0.5, no ROI, ref = idx 1 of each camera, 8 logical threads.
- downscale 1.0: batch avg 386 / p95 411 / max 490 ms (!thin margin; max with decode 431) - total 38 s for 990 frames.
- downscale 0.7: batch avg 191 / p95 241 / max 279 ms.
- downscale 0.5: batch avg 95 / p95 106 / max 115 ms (with decode up to 152 ms).
- Rejects at thr 2%: 199 / 178 / 160 of 990 (1.0 / 0.7 / 0.5) -> verdicts depend on downscale, so thresholds must be tuned at the downscale that will be used in production.
- Recommendation: run production at downscale 0.7 (or 0.5) for 1224x1024 frames; 1.0 leaves almost no margin to 500 ms.

## D11 - Integration into Defect Detector V3 (2026-10-20, planning only)
Decision: build a C++ drop-in replacement of analisSurface (same HTTP contract) using the CppDetector inspection core; no new features (no learning, FP zones, sub-zones). Details, contract facts and open questions: integration-in-main-application.md.
Why: the main app's Java orchestrator talks to analisSurface over HTTP + shared memory; a replacement is transparent if the contract is identical.
Status: reviewed branch core-dev-p; awaiting user approval before any code.

## D12 - Integration decisions approved by the user (2026-10-20)
Score scale `min(1, area%/5)`; only real settings (sensitivity, threshold, shift_tolerance, min_blob_area, inspect_scale) per camera profile; the orchestrator and the UI are adapted to cppAnalisSurface (isolated new Java client, new settings panel/proxy), legacy Python path left untouched behind `python_detector.backend`; one multi-threaded process; the module lives in the main repo `defect-detector-v3/cppAnalisSurface`; the user commits, Claude never commits there. Details and file list: integration-in-main-application.md.

## D13 - Java serialised requests per client (2026-10-20)
Context: `InspectPythonExecutor` used Semaphore(1) per client (Python/GIL). Decision: lane permits come from `python_detector.server_concurrency` (default 1 keeps Python behaviour). Why: a single C++ process must receive all 10 camera requests at once. Consequence: for cpp use `python_parallelism: 10` (see D16: 1 serialises the cameras), `python_server_pool_size: 1`, `server_concurrency: 10`, `python_request_parallelism: 10`.

## D14 - HTTP thread pool must exceed client connections (2026-10-20)
Finding: cpp-httplib serves one keep-alive connection per thread. With pool `workers+4` (8) and 10 Java connections, two requests waited the keep-alive timeout (5 s). Fix: pool `max(64, workers*4)`; CPU concurrency is bounded separately by the `workers` limiter. Do not shrink the pool.

## D15 - Inspector changes for the service (2026-10-20)
Per-scale prepared reference cache (inspect_scale arrives per request/profile); analysis restricted to ROI bounding box; shift estimation on a <=256 px thumbnail (cheap, subpixel via phaseCorrelate+Hanning); heatmap built on the downscaled image. Measured: 10 parallel full-size frames 152-179 ms (CppDetector's first version: 386 ms).

## D16 - python_parallelism = 1 serialised the whole detector stage (found 2026-10-20 from the user's log)
Symptom: with the cpp detector (38-44 ms per call) the 10-camera cycle still took ~680 ms: all cameras started together and captured in parallel (234-302 ms), but results finished one after another every ~40 ms (= one detector call), and `idle = total_ms - pipeline_ms` grew linearly (1, 45, 77, 112 ... 281 ms).
Cause: `PipelineCameraRuntimeService` creates the `stage-python` executor with `python_parallelism` threads (also the number of HTTP clients). My config.exemple set it to 1 ("one client per process") -> only one detector call at a time. My mistake in D13/integration doc.
Fix: `python_parallelism: 10` (= number of cameras processed at the same time). Expected cycle: capture of the slowest camera (~300 ms) + ~50 ms detection + decision, i.e. ~350-400 ms instead of ~680 ms. To be re-measured after the user's config change.
Rule: `python_parallelism` must be >= number of cameras whose frames can arrive together; `python_request_parallelism` is capped by `camera_parallelism`.

## D17 - cppAnalisSurface logging (2026-10-21)
Context: the user wants logs that let Claude tune the analysis (sensitivity, threshold, shift_tolerance, min_blob_area, inspect_scale, ROI) from real production data.
Decision: `cppAnalisSurface/logs/` (app root: nearest parent of the exe holding CMakeLists.txt; override `--log-dir`). `cas-YYYY-MM-DD.log` = events (start, reference/ROI/settings changes, errors, slow >400 ms, one summary line per product per minute). `inspections-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` = one record per inspection with settings, scale, shift + phase-correlation response, brightness gain/means, pixel threshold, diff mean/p99/max in ROI, blob counts, biggest dropped blob (near-miss), per-zone area and peak diff, timings incl. worker-slot wait and shm read, camera id parsed from `<product>#cam=<id>`.
Why sampling: 10 cameras every ~400 ms = ~25 records/s = ~2-3 GB/day if all are written. Rejects, near-misses (score >= threshold/2), requests >400 ms and all non-`/inspect-shm` calls are logged in full; calm frames 1 of 20 per product. Daily cap 500 MB for the jsonl, files older than 14 days are deleted at start.
Consequences: extra diagnostics are computed on every inspection (a few small OpenCV ops on the ROI box, histogram for p99); not part of the API response (C12 untouched). Verdicts depend on inspect_scale (D10), so the record always carries it.

## D18 - Label seam geometry check (2026-10-21)
Context: the seam (thin bright line along the label edge, camera 4 of frames36) must be straight; a kink in the middle = reject, the same kink near the ends = acceptable (tunable). Reference diff cannot express a position-dependent tolerance and the bucket pose changes between shots, so diff on the 2-3 px line gives false zones.
Decision: separate measurement, not a diff (src/inspect/seam.{h,cpp}). User sets two ends of the seam (original px) + search band. Per cross-section: coarse straight line from the ridge maximum, then left/right edge of the line at half height (sub-pixel). Each edge is fitted with a robust quadratic (line + cylinder curvature); deviation = residual. Tolerance by position: `tol_mid` in the middle, `tol_edge` within `edge_frac` of each end, first/last 3% not evaluated (line-end artefacts ~10 px). Reject if any |residual| > tolerance; reason `seam_deviation`. Frames where the line is not found (no label) do not reject by the seam (the main diff covers a missing label). Combined verdict = main diff OR seam; the primary reason is the main one, `seam` object is always in the result.
Evidence (python prototype, camera_4, 1224x1024): 80 labelled frames: edge residual 0.2-0.4 px; 20 unlabelled frames: seam not found. User examples: kink in the middle 3.7 px at t=0.43 (reject, ratio 3.7); end deviation ~3.4 px at t~0.04 (ratio 0.7 with tol_edge 5 -> ok); a straight seam 0.27.
Consequences: seam settings are per camera (config `seam`), UI card "Стык этикетки". The seam strip should be excluded from the diff ROI if it produces false zones. NOT yet compiled/tested on the build machine at the time of writing (no MSVC/OpenCV C++ on the dev box) - rebuild and check first. Not yet ported to cppAnalisSurface (would map to the `geometry_status` field of the Java contract).
